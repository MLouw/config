My configuration files
======================

Contains configurations for:

* xmonad
* i3status (used with xmobar and xmonad)
* Vim
* bash

A note on xmonad
----------------
You may want to use the xmonad.start script provided here. It sets the background, runs xmobar/i3status and starts dropbox.

If you want to use it, you should open /usr/share/xsessions/xmonad.desktop, and change the Exec field so it points to ~/xmonad.start instead of xmonad.
